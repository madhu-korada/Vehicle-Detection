# Vehicle-Detection
In this project, the 2D vision data from a reference camera is taken as input. 

The camera was fixed on a truck and video data was acquired for a certain time under different weather and road conditions in India. 

The acquired video data had a resolution of 640x480 with 30 fps.

The objectives of the project with respect to Vehicle Detection are as follows:

- To detect (classify & localize) vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signals, animals, etc. in the given    sample videos. 

- To reduce the number of false negatives and false positives. 

- To achieve 90% mAP (mean Average Precision). 

- To increase robustness to get desired results in all scenes such as sunny, shadowed as well as in the dark. 

- To export the acquired frame data and write it in a .CSV file. 

# Deep learning frameworks

A Deep Learning Framework is a building block for designing, training and validating Deep Neural networks. Given that deep learning is the key to executing tasks of higher level of sophistication, building and deploying them successfully proves to be quite the herculean challenge for data scientists and data engineers across the globe. Today, we have a myriad of frameworks at our disposal that allows us to develop tools that can offer a better level of abstraction along with simplification of difficult programming challenges.

There are a variety of deep learning frameworks available. Each framework is built in a different manner for different purposes. They vary based on the languages they support, CNN modeling capability, RNN modeling capability, speed, etc. The comparison of the frameworks is given below.

TensorFlow was chosen as the framework for vehicle detection based on the following factors:

- Python Interface

-	Well documented tutorials and references

- Increasing contributions on GitHub

- Excellent CNN Modelling capability

- Straight-forward & modular architecture

- Great speed with different datasets

- Multiple GPU support

- Keras compatible
