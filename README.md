# Vehicle-Detection
In this project, the 2D vision data from a reference camera is taken as input. 

The camera was fixed on a truck and video data was acquired for a certain time under different weather and road conditions in India. 

The acquired video data had a resolution of 640x480 with 30 fps.

The objectives of the project with respect to Vehicle Detection are as follows:

- To detect (classify & localize) vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signals, animals, etc. in the given    sample videos. 

- To reduce the number of false negatives and false positives. 

- To achieve 90% mAP (mean Average Precision). 

- To increase robustness to get desired results in all scenes such as sunny, shadowed as well as in the dark. 

- To export the acquired frame data and write it in a .CSV file.
